# Radio or Keysmash?

A simple website that chooses either a random string of characters or a mobile networking radio and has you guess which one it is.

This was made to demonstrate how ridiculous some vendors' naming schemes are.

## Development

Radio data is stored in `src/data` as a JSON file per-vendor. The JSON file should contain an object where radio full names are keys and their
model numbers are values.

Keysmash generators should be built to look "realistic" for each vendor. For example, most "random" keysmashes start with an `A` for Nokia, with
a limited number starting with `F` to appropriate proportions with the real-world AirScale radio list.

To facilitate this, there is a helper function called `randomChoice` which allows you to supply and array of choices, with an optional second
parameter to supply an array of weights to influcence the randomness.

For more info, check out the [Nokia generator file](./src/functions/generators/generateNokiaRadio.ts).

### Adding more vendors

To add a new vendor, you should:

- create a JSON object of all real radios and their models in `src/data`
- create a new generator for the vendor in `src/functions/generators`
- add the vendor to the `radioSets` dictionary and interface definition in `src/functions/chooseRandomRadio.ts`
- add the vendor's generator to the `generators` dictionary in `src/functions/generateRandomRadio.ts`

...and that should be it!
